# Overview
R code used to calculate a labour market concentration index as in Azar et al. (2018), with German CEDEFOP data.
The index measures how concentrated a local labour market is from the perspective of a potential employee. For each occupation, region and time period, a limited number of potential employers are posting vacancies. 
Depending on the number and market shares of employers, this local labour market segment can be very concentrated. This concept is similar to market power born of concentration in product markets. 
This might allow employers to force workers to accept wages below equilibrium levels, because moving or waiting is costly for employees.

The index implemented here uses the following definitions for local labour market segments:
- Occupation by isco_level 4
- Timeframe of one quarter
- Geographic region in terms of functional urban areas (EU definition)

As input, it uses job ad data from CEDEFOP, provided by the EU Dataplatform.
